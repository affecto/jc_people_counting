# Release Notes, ver 1.0
## released on October 12th 

This repository contains C++ 11 implementation on algorithms such as people counting
and face detector with 3rd party library. 

# Script to run the program
* $ ./jc_pilot [configuration .json file name], e.g.
``` 
./jc_pilot conf_local.json 
```

# Change made to system configuration
* The way to configure the program has been changed in this release. Now it is done 
by parsing .json file that one can check out [the example for system configuration] (configurations/conf_local.json)

# Change made to verbosity configuration
* Now using [easylogging++ single header library] (https://github.com/easylogging/easyloggingpp) to control different levels of verbosity, 
e.g. "info", "debug", "fatal", etc. The program automatically ends if it shows message
in the "fatal" level.
* Check [the example for verbosity configuration] (configurations/logger.conf)

# New features added
* Support one performing face detection in pre-defined ROI region.
If one would like to define the ROI region where face detectors are performed as the
following example, 

![ROI for face detectors](doc_images/fd_roi.png)

one should add the following line into .json system configuration file.

``` 
"roi" : [0.1, 0.15, 0.9, 0.75] 
``` 
Please notice that these are the normalized coordinates (from 0 to 1) with respect 
to the image's width and height.

* Support one excluding the areas **within the active area for face detector**. 
If one would like to define the deactivated region in which face detectors would not
take any effect as the following example does, 

![ROI for face detectors](doc_images/fd_dcroi.png)

one should add the following into .json system configuration file 
```
"dontcare_rois" : [[0.3, 0.01, 0.4, 0.4], [0.6, 0.6, 0.7, 0.9]]
```
Please notice that these are the normalized coordinates (from 0 to 1) with respect
to **active area's width and height** and the origin is the top left corner of 
the active area marked with blue dot and (0,0) in the figure above.
